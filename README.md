## Project :- student performance Prediction in Exam

### Project Overview 
                   
                    The project aims to predict the performance of students in an exam using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project consists of various features such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course, etc., and the target variable is the final test score. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the test scores of students based on these features. The project can be useful for teachers and educational institutions to identify students who may need extra support or intervention to improve their academic performance. Additionally, it can also help students to understand which factors are most important in determining their exam scores, and how they can improve their performance.
